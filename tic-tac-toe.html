        <p>This is a temporary page for testing. You are on the "Game 2" page. This will eventually have a game called Break Blocks, a game inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)">Break Out</a>.</p>
        <p>Break Out is a very popular game for new programmers to recreate for practice. This will be the most complex of the games I make on this site, as it has realtime movement.</p>
